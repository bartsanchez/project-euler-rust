# project-euler-rust

The aim of this project is to learn the Rust language:

https://www.rust-lang.org/

## Disclaimer

This project should not be considered as "good practices" neither for the
implemented solution nor for the Rust code generated. Since I am creating
this project for learning myself, it should ideally evolve as long as I acquire
deeper Rust knowledge.

## Execute solution

In order to obtain the solution of each problem, you just need to run:

```sh
$ cargo run
```

inside of the desired problem folder.

## Testing solutions

In order to test each of solved problems, you just need to run:

```sh
$ cargo test
```

inside of the desired problem folder.
