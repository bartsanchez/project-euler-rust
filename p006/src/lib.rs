//! The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
//! 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
//!
//! The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
//! (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
//!
//! Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
//! natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
//!
//! Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
//! hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// assert_eq!(p006::f(10), 2640);
/// assert_eq!(p006::f(100), 25164150);
/// ```

        .fold(0, | sum, x | sum + x);

    let sum: i32 = (1..(max_number + 1)).fold(0, | sum, x | sum + x);

    sum * sum - sum_squares
